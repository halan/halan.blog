Hi there, I'm Halan. I started working in software engineering a few years after the dot-com boom and have now been doing it for 20 years. My main focus has been on using Ruby and JavaScript, but I've also gained some knowledge in cryptography, functional programming, and other related areas. I'm using this platform to share my thoughts, document my learning, and teach others. Feel free to share my content and reach out to me for a discussion. Just a heads up, I won't be adding a comment section.

I aim to maintain a minimalist and hacker aesthetic on this platform. You can expect to find a lot of code and text here, but not much else.

I am proud to be employed at [Codeminer42](https://codeminer42.com), a Brazilian consultancy company.
Currently, I am working as a contractor for [GoDaddy](https://godaddy.com).
If you are looking for a job like mine, please check out the [careers page](https://www.codeminer42.com/careers).
